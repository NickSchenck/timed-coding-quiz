under a timer. It will have a button to begin the quiz, which will direct the user to the first question and start
the timer. When the user enters an input for a given question they will advance to the next question. If they enter
an incorrect option they will have time deducted from their total. Once all questions are answered the user will be
presented with their time left, an option to save their score, and an option to view scores that have been saved.
